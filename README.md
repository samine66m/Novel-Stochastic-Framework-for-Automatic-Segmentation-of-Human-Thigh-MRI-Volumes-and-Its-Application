# Novel-Stochastic-Framework-for-Automatic-Segmentation-of-Human-Thigh-MRI-Volumes-and-Its-Application
# The codes in this repository are designed for automatic thigh MRI segmentation task for central 50 slices between greater trochanter and lateral epicondyle of the femur
# To run these codes you need Water-suppressed and Fat-Suppressed grayscale MRI images and the ground truth masks for the atlas and calculating accuracy
